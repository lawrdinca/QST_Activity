Based on the initial input(Account.java) the following steps were performed:

(The project is also available on github: https://github.com/lawrdinca/SQT_Activity/tree/master/Assignment02_DincaLaurentiuGabriel

1. The package "ro.ase.csie.cts.homework1.models.account" was created;
2. The "Account.java" file was placed in the above mentioned package;
3. The format of the given file is bad. Spacing between operators and/or attributes was added. Right indentention was added. Spacing in/between bracktes was also added --> Formatting (CLEAN CODE principle);
4. Some variable names are not respecting the lowerCamelCase principle: loan_value & account_type are now loanValue & accountType (GENERAL PROGRAMMING principle);
5. The enum "AccountType.java" was created and added to the above mentioned package. It replaces the public static final attributes: STANDARD, BUDGET, PREMIUM,SUPER_PREMIUM (GENERAL PROGRAMMINGprinciple);
6. The method loan() was renamed into getLoan() (CLEAN CODE Principle);
7. The method getRate() was renamed into getInterestRate() (CLEAN CODE Principle);
8. The to_string method was removed. the toString() method using a StringBuilder instead of string concatenation was generated (GENERAL PROGRAMMING principle);
9. The print() method was removed since it does not do anything --> Avoid creating unnecessary objects (PERFORMANCE principle);
10. All the println() were removed from getLoan() and getInterestRate()
11. The package "ro.ase.csie.homework1.exceptions" was created;
12. The package "ro.ase.csie.homework1.interfaces" was created;
13. The InterestRateInterface was created and contains the abstract method "getMonthlyInterestRate" because it needs to be included in every class. The initial method was removed and the interface was implemented(GENERAL PROGRAMMING principle)
